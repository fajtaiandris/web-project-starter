# Web Project Starter

Node `v18.12.1`

This project was started by following through [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvzXuAu7XHk).
After that, swagger and codegen were added based on [this tutorial](https://notiz.dev/blog/angular-nest-openapi-codegen), but additional tweakings were necessary to make the lib imports work correctly.
